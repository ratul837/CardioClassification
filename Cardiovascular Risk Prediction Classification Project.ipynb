The dataset provided informationon over 4,000 patients and included 15 attributes, each representing a potential risk factor for CHD. These attributes included demographic,behavioral, and medical risk factors.\n","\n","To prepare the data for analysis, extensive preprocessing was performed to clean and transform the data. This included handling missingvalues using median, mode, as well as identifying and removing outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Skewed continuousvariables were also transformed using log and square root transformations to reduce skewness and improve model performanceFeature.\n","\n","Feature selection was performed using variance inflation factor to remove multicollinearity and a new feature called pulse pressure was createdto capture the relationship between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Redundant columns were also removed to simplify the dataset. Themost important features for predicting CHD risk were identified as 'age', 'sex', 'education', 'cigs_per_day', 'bp_meds', 'prevalent _stroke','prevalent_hyp', 'diabetes', 'total_cholesterol', 'bmi, 'heart _rate', 'glucose', and 'pulse_pressure'.\n","\n","To handle the imbalanced nature of the dataset, the SMOTE combined with Tomek links undersampling technique was used to balance theclass distribution and improve model performance. The data was also scaled using standard scalar method to ensure that all features were onthe same scale.\n","\n","Several machine learning models were evaluated on their performance on the primary evaluation metric of recall. After careful analysis, theNeural Network (tuned) was chosen as the final prediction model because it had the highest recall score among the models evaluated. By selecting a model with a high recall score, the goal was to correctly identify as many patients with CHD risk as possible, even if it meant having\n","some false positives.\n","\n","Overall, this project demonstrated the potential of machine learning techniques to accurately predict CHD risk in patients using data from a\n","cardiovascular study.

As a result, it is critical that we accurately predict the risk of heart disease in order to avert as many fatalities as possible.\n","\n","Therefore, the problem statement is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict an individual's risk of developing CVD by incorporating a wide range of variables, including demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors.

In our analysis, we found that the Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier had the highest recall score among the models we evaluated.\n","\n","We chose recall as our primary evaluation metric because correctly identifying patients with CHD risk is critical to achieving our business objectives. By selecting a model with a high recall score, we aim to ensure that we correctly identify as many patients with CHD risk as possible, even if it means that we may have some false positives.
